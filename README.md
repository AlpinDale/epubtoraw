# epubtoraw
A little tool made to convert epub files to raw text.


# How to use
Make the scripts executable:

```
$ chmod +x etg start.sh
```

Then simply run the `start.sh` file and follow instructions. It'll create a text file in the same folder with all the chapters added together.


# To Do
- Add batch conversion
- Clean up the outputted text
- Eventually add optional functionality to print out dialogues separately
- Attach speaker names to dialogues with machine learning
